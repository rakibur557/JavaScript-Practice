# Life in Weeks Coding Excercise

Problem:

I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realized just how little time we actually have.
In yhis challenge, you are going to create a function taht tells us that how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live untill 90 years old.

It will take ypour current age as the input and conlose.logs a message with our time left in this format:
You have X days, Y weeks, and Z months left. Where X,Y,Z are replaced with the accutual calculated numbers.

For this challege, assume there are 365 days in a year 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
